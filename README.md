## 🧪 1. BSF Breeding Unit – Smart Environment Optimizer

We’ve developed a custom **PCB-based control system** that monitors and regulates environmental parameters to **maximize BSF egg production**.

**Key Features**:
- 🌡️ Temperature, 💧 humidity, and 💡 light intensity sensors for real-time environment tracking.
- Built-in **humidifier** for moisture control.
- Adjustable LED lighting to simulate day/night cycles.
- Feedback control system for consistent and optimal breeding conditions.

## ♻️ 2. Composting Unit – Waste-to-Protein Converter

This unit receives **organic waste + BSF eggs** from the breeding unit and processes them into:
- 🐛 BSF larvae (for high-protein feed)
- 🌱 Organic compost (frass)

**Core Technologies**:
- **Raspberry Pi 4** as the main controller.
- **AMG8833 thermal camera** for real-time monitoring.
- 🧠 **Machine Learning** models (in progress) for:
  - Growth pattern recognition
  - Larval development tracking
  - Compost health analysis
